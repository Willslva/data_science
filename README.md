* **Sales Dashboard:** https://bit.ly/3uUpl2r 
<p align="justify"> In this case study, data from 2016 to 2019 is used to facilitate the understanding of the company's CEO regarding the sale of cars. Basically, descriptive analysis will be worked in this context, therefore, Power BI fits perfectly for the business problem. However, if the CEO had asked to forecast the volume of car sales for the next year then the approach to solving the problem would be data science, specifically with predictive analytics.
